    <!-- It is not necessary to explicitly define an id - this is only required when the name
         of the configuration file does not match the id generated. For example, an id element
         would NOT be required if this file was called "template.region3.template-with-regions.xml". 
         This is because the Component is looked up using a generated path when an id is NOT present -->
