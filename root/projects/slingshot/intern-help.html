<h1>Automated Testing</h1>
<p><em>"To be good at testing software you must be a constructive schizophrenic. Be clear about the difference between your role as a programmer and as a tester. The tester in you must be suspicious, uncompromising, hostile, and compulsively obsessed with destroying, utterly destroying, the programmer's software. The tester in you is your Mr. Hyde – your Incredible Hulk. He must exercise what Gruenberger calls 'low cunning'."</em> – Boris Beizer</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>If you intend to run your tests against <strong>Sauce Labs</strong>, and assuming that you are using the <strong>deveng</strong>, please add the following configuration block to the end of your <em>bash_profile</em>. Obviously you will want to replace the <em>username</em> and <em>access_key</em> with those provided by <strong>Sauce Labs</strong>.<br /><strong>Note:</strong> Your <em>bash_profile</em> is usually found in your cygwin_home directory</p>
<pre>
# Sauce Labs configuration
export SAUCE_USERNAME=<em>{username}</em>
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<em>{********-****-****-****-************}</em>
</pre>
<p>Sauce Connect cannot tunnel <em>localhost</em> on anything but a few very standard ports. Port 8081 is not included in that list so it is necessary to provide a host lookup for 127.0.0.1 on your machine. Please add the following entry to your hosts file:</p>
<pre>
# Sauce Labs host lookup for 127.0.0.l
127.0.0.1&#09;local.alfresco.test
</pre>

<h2>Running tests with a local instance of Selenium</h2>
<p>Before running tests against a local instance of <strong>Selenium</strong> make sure it is running. Please run the following commands from a new cygwin window with the correct <em>project</em> name:</p>
<pre>
$ workon <em>project</em>
$ cd projects/slingshot
$ node node_modules/intern/runner.js config=tests/intern_local.js
</pre>

<h2>Running tests with a Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>Before running tests against a local <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> you will need to bring the machine up. Please refer to the Vagrant help file if you do not know how to do that. If you are happy that the VM is running, please run the following commands from a new cygwin window with the correct <em>project</em> name:</p>
<pre>
$ workon <em>project</em>
$ cd projects/slingshot
$ node node_modules/intern/runner.js config=tests/intern.js
</pre>

<h2>Running tests with Sauce Labs</h2>
<p>Before running tests against <strong>Sauce Labs</strong> you will need to adhere to the configuration details shown above. If you are happy that the configuration is complete, please run the following commands from a new cygwin window with the correct <em>project</em> name:</p>
<pre>
$ workon <em>project</em>
$ cd projects/slingshot
$ node node_modules/intern/runner.js config=tests/intern_sl.js
</pre>
