 * This exception should be thrown when a content operation could not be performed due to

 * same action might succeed, all other things not having changed.
 * <p/>
 * An example of this would be the case where a request to create a thumbnail
 * has failed because the necessary thumbnailing software is not available e.g. because the OpenOffice.org process
 * is not currently running.
