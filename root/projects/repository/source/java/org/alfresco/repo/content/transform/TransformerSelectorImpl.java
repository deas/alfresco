/**
 * Default transformer selector implementation, which sorts by priority and then
 * by average transform time. The transform time is only used once a threshold
 * (number of transforms) has been reached. This average is maintained for each
 * source target mimetype pair.<p>
 * 
 * Prior to the introduction of this class the transformation time was only kept
 * for each transformer. There was no threshold and there was a concept of
 * 'Explicit' transformers, which would cause all other transformers to be discarded.
 * It is still possible to disable transformers by giving adding unsupported mappings
 * as has been done for transformers that would not have been used in the past as
 * there existed one or more 'explicit' transformers (a concept not used by this
 * TransformerSelector). By default a transformer has a priority of {@code 10}.
 * Old 'Explicit' transformers have been given a priority of {@code 5}.
