These branches are forked from alfresco community svn
http://svn.alfresco.com/repos/alfresco-open-mirror/alfresco/HEAD.

The purpose of this repository is to support collaborative bugfixing for community release code.

Update 12/17/2014: Unfortunately, it proved to be easier for me to implement fixes as drop-in extension
code in most cases. Even though I think this approach is somewhat broken thats, how things are for now.
Given that, I will commit fixes to this repo only if the "fix as extension approach" does not work for some
reason.
